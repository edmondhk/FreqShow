FreqShow
========

Raspberry Pi &amp; PiTFT-based RTL-SDR frequency scanning and display tool.  See installation and usage instructions in the guide at: https://learn.adafruit.com/freq-show-raspberry-pi-rtl-sdr-scanner/overview

Forked from adafruit/FreqShow

Feature added:

Peak hold
Peak hold line
Offset

Note: Default offset value based on my RTL-SDR dongle, need calibration on other SDR device

My raspberry pi run on HDMI touch screen, so default using fb0 as output. Use fb1 instead if using adafruit screen(untested)
